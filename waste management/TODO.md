# TODO: Optimize Epochs for Speed and 96-98% Accuracy

## Completed
- [x] Analyze code (train.py, model.py, evaluate.py, dataset.py)
- [x] Run initial test to check for errors
- [x] Add mixed precision training to train.py
- [x] Increase batch size to 32
- [x] Reduce epochs to 25
- [x] Adjust learning rate to 5e-4 for faster convergence
- [x] Optimize model fusion layer for speed

## Completed
- [x] Run optimized training and verify accuracy
- [x] Update evaluate.py to reflect real accuracy if needed
